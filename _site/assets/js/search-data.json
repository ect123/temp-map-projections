    "content": "Coordinate Reference Systems . Now I’m going to complicate things a bit by introducing the term coordinate reference system (CRS), of which projections are a part. . Let’s break down the term a bit. . You may all be familiar with a coordinate system from your algebra days. A coordinate system defines a location in 2-dimensional space on an XY axis. . A two dimensional grid with an x and y axis. (c) Limaner , Public Domain. &nbsp; . So, what’s the problem? . We live on a 3-dimensional earth that is neither perfectly round nor perfectly spherical. . The shape of the earth is mathematically approximated by something called a geoid, which tries to account for the irregularity of the earth’s surface. . | An ellipsoid is a smooth-surfaced sphere, onto which we can assign coordinates to specific locations, reflected in degrees of latitude and longitude. . | . A datum aligns a geoid with the ellipsoid at a particular location. (c) Manuel Gimond, CC BY-NC 4.0. &nbsp; . So we need a coordinate system that adapts to the Earth’s shape. . Understanding geoids and ellipsoids. (c) Rhumb Line Maps. &nbsp; . A CRS does this by defining the translation between a location on the earth and that location on a flattened, 2 dimensional coordinate system. . A CRS comprises: . Coordinate system: XY grid | Horizontal and vertical units: units used to define the grid along XY(and Z) axis | Datum: A model of the earth | Projection: mathematical equation used to flatten the surface of the earth onto a 2-dimensional plane , i.e. a paper map or a computer screen. | . Cartesian versus spherical, or geographic, coordinates. PostGIS. &nbsp; . At this point you might be wondering what a datum is. We’ll address this in the next section before we go on to talk about two different kinds of coordinate systems used in geospatial software. .

    "title": "Choosing the Right Projection",
    "content": "How to Select the Right Projection . Keep in mind that all projections either disort or preserve one of the following properties: . Area/Size Size of a feature on the map is the same relative to its size on the earth . | Shape/Angle Shapes appear the same on a map as they do on the earth Maps that preserve shape are called conformal . | Distance Line between one point on the map and another is the same distance as it is on the earth Equidistant maps preserve the true scale for all straight lines passing through a single location, such as Vancouver . | Direction/Azimuth Directions from a central location to all other points on the map will be shown correctly . | . It is useful to think about projections grouped by the properties they preserve. . Equal area projections . preserve the area of specific features | distort shape and angle | . The British Columbia (BC) Albers Equal Area Conic projection is an example of an equal area projection. This is used province wide when mapping land-use data and is used by BC Environment in part because it represents the whole province on one projection plane. . Albers Equal Area Conic . The Albers Equal Area Conic projection. GISGeography. &nbsp; . Conformal projections . preserve angles and shape | distort area | lat/long lines intersect at 90-degree angles on the map | . The UTM Zone 10N projection is a good example. This could be used, for example, when mapping the location of invasive plant species in Vancouver parks. For most GIS analysis work, equal area and conformal map projections are used. . Lambert Conformal Conic . The Lambert Conformal Conic projection. GISGeography. &nbsp; . Equidistant projections . preserve distances between points by maintaining the scale of a given dataset | Outside the given dataset, scale becomes more distorted | . The Two-Point Equidistant projection is one example of this and allows one to arbitrarily choose two points on the map – the straight-line distance between these points is correct and is used by airports. . True-direction or azimuthal projections . preserve direction from one point to all other points by maintaining some of the great circle arcs | can be combined with equal area, conformal, and equidistant projections | . The Lambert Equal Area Azimuthal projection and the Azimuthal Equidistant projection are examples of azimuthal projections. . Characteristics of Map Projections . Projection Category Properties Common Uses . Conformal | Preserves local shapes and angles | Topographic maps, navigation charts, weather maps | . Equal Area | Preserves areas | Dot density maps, thematic maps | . Equidistant | Preserves distance from one or two specified points to all other points on the map | Maps of airline distances, seismic maps showing distances from an earthquake epicenter | . Azimuthal | All directions are true from a single specified point (usually the center) to all other points on the map | Navigation and route planning maps | . Compromise | No point is completely distortion free; distortion is minimized near the center and along the equator | World maps | .

    "content": "This is a great video to introduce the topic of datums and how they relate to coordinate reference systems. I recommend you watch it on your own. . Coordinate System Jargon . Datums . So just what is a datum? . Remember that the earth is unevenly shaped. . A datum mathematically defines the shape and size of the earth and it’s orientation in space. . Measurements of the surface of the earth in different places collected over time by surveyors are used to define a geodetic datum. . Shifts in the surface of the earth, such as following an earthquake like occurred in New Zealand in 2011, mean that new measurements have to be taken. Tectonic geodesy compares surveys done at different times to measure elevation changes before and after earthquakes that cause deformations in the earth’s crust. . Rupture along River Road in Christchurch, NZ as a result of February 2011 earthquake. Source: Martin Hunter/Getty Images AsiaPac. &nbsp; . Another way to think about datums is that they are a reference for a starting point against which to determine other horizontal or vertical measurements. . For example, a datum ensures that engineers, surveyors, planners, and mapmakers are all starting at the same “zero” elevation. . First precise vertical survey in 1883 along the Richelieu and St. Lawrence Rivers, Government of Canada. &nbsp; . Horizontal and Vertical Datums . A horizontal datum measures positions on the surface of the Earth using latitude and longitude. . A horizontal datum is used to monitor the movement of the Earth’s crust, or in other words, to monitor earthquake activity. . Horizontal datums are also used with geospatial data. All geospatial data should have a defined horizontal datum. . A vertical datum defines the height either above or below a nationally defined reference surface (e.g., mean sea level). . Not all geospatial data needs to have a defined vertical datum, but it makes sense if you are using elevation data in a GIS. . There is a relatively new vertical datum for BC, important for any sea level rise mapping and accuracy. . A Brief History of Datums . This history varies according to country. . Although Canada and the U.S.A. have different surveying histories, they have used the same datum since 1913 because they are on the same continent, along with Mexico. . In 1901, the Meades Ranch triangulation station in Kansas (established in 1891) was chosen as the point relative to which all land measurements in the United States were made, in part of because of its geographic centrality to the nation. . Meades Ranch Triangulation Station. GISGeography. &nbsp; . In 1913, both Canada and Mexico decided to adopt this station as the starting point as well. . As a result, the name of the datum was changed. . Reflection Question . (Click the text for the answer) . Who can guess what that datum and subsequent datums became called? North American Datum 1913, North American Datum 1927, and so on. . Below is a breakdown of the differences between the most common datums currently in use in this part of the world. . North American Datum 1927 . uses the Clarke Ellipsoid of 1866 | reference point at Meade’s Ranch, Kansas | many control points calculated from observations in the 1800s | developed using 26,000 stations | . Survey monument on Flora Peak in Chilliwack Lake Provincial Park. Photo: Maya Daurio &nbsp; . North American Datum 1983 . uses the Geodetic Reference System (GRS80) | uses the Earth’s centre as the reference point rather than a ranch in Kansas | based on both ground measurements and satellite information | developed using 250,000 stations | from 1986 to 2011, this datum has been adjusted four times | uses an ellipsoid that tries to fit North America, so it’s more accurate for this part of the world | . World Geodetic System of 1984 (WGS 1984) . developed by U.S. Department of Defense using Doppler observations from the Navy Navigation Satellite System (NNSS) | assumed to be identical to original NAD 83 in conterminous U.S. | later iterations in 1996 and 2002 based entirely on GPS observations | used by military and GPS systems | uses an ellipsoid that attempts to account for the entire world | . Another datum coming down the pike (2022) . the National Geodetic Survey in the U.S. is currently working on a new North American Datum | will rely on Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) and Global Positioning Systems (GPS) | will use an updated geoid (hypothetical mean sea level) model | . Why Should You Care? . for starters, you will inevitably encounter errors working with GIS data, and understanding datums and coordinate systems can help you troubleshoot those errors | coordinates change depending on the datum and spheroid on which they’re based, even if they are using the same map projection | . For example, the geographic coordinates below are for a single point located within the city of Bellingham, Washington, using 3 different datums: . DATUM X-Coordinate Y-Coordinate . NAD_1927 | -122.466903686523 | 48.7440490722656 | . NAD_1983 | -122.46818353793 | 48.7438798543649 | . WGS_1984 | -122.46818353793 | 48.7438798534299 | . Offset between two points in Bellingham in NAD 1927 and NAD 1983, respectively. The point using coordinates from the WGS 1984 datum is projected on the fly and corresponds to the NAD 1983 point. Photo: Maya Daurio. &nbsp; . While it is unlikely you’ll ever encounter data registered to NAD 1913, there are still data you may encounter in NAD 1927, especially if you’re working with survey control data. .

If you are going to work with geospatial data, you need to understand the difference between the two and when it is appropriate to use one over the other. . Geographic Coordinate System (GCS) . a system which spans the entire globe | uses latitude and longitude | based on angles measured on a sphere, usually expressed in degrees | not reliable for measuring distance or area because degrees of longitude are not constant | . The world as a sphere with latitude and longitude values, Melita Kennedy, Esri. &nbsp; . Latitude and longitude are the typical units used by GCS and are expressed in decimal degrees. . Two of the most common GCS in North America are WGS1984 (used in GPS) and NAD83 (used in surveying and mapping in North America). . You can identify any location in the world using a latitude and longitude. . But these are angular measures, not measures of distance. . In order to more accurately measure distances between places on the surface of the earth or to better represent shapes and sizes in particular areas of the world, we use a projected coordinate system. . Projected Coordinate System . contains a GCS but projects it onto a flat surface | units are linear, often in meters | optimized for a particular location to minimize distortion | consists of lines on a grid at right angles to each other | .

The area represents the area of Canada in meters. . Reflection Question . (Click the text for the answer) . Why are the numbers representing area different for the two projections? The Web Mercator projection does not minimize distortion except for shape, and measurements are most accurate close to the standard parallel, which is the Equator, and less accurate the farther away you get from this line. . See this Measuring distances and areas when your map uses the Mercator projection blog post for further explanation about the follies of measuring distances and areas in Web Mercator. . Calculating Population Density . 8 Create a new field in the CAN_webMercator layer called popDensity. To do this, in the top left of the attribute table select Field:Add.

Who remembers which projection Google Maps uses and why? Web Mercator - Wherever you are on the map, up and down are north and south and left and right are west and east - Preserves angles of roads - At large scales, the conformality of the projection preserves shapes, such as buildings - Objects around the equator are to scale relative to one another, while objects closer to the poles appear larger than they really are . This projection became widespread when web cartography became commonplace because interactive maps centered on street-level navigation. This projection does not work as well on a global scale, however. Our web maps have evolved to cover more area across the globe in one map, but our use of different projections to accommodate this shift has not.

    "title": "Map Projections",
    "content": "Map Projections . Let’s revisit some of the main topics we have covered so far. . See if you can answer the questions below before you reveal the correct answer by clicking on the text of the question. . What are the two different kinds of coordinate systems? Geographic and projected. . It is best to measure distance and area with a coordinate system using latitude and longitude as its units. True or False. False. Latitude and longitude are angular measures and not appropriate for measuring distance or area. Use a projected coordinate system to more accurately measure distances between two locations on the surface of the earth. . Who can identify the projection below and which properties it preserves and distorts? - The Web Mercator projection preserves direction and shape. - In web maps, it&#39;s also good for generating map tiles because it projects the world into a square evenly subdivided across zoom levels, and 90 degree turns appear as right angles. - The Mercator projection distorts size, or area. Notice the classic example of comparing the size of Greenland to the continent of Africa in this map. . Which projection am I? (c) TheCrazyWhovian , CC BY-SA 4.0. &nbsp; . Recap . Projections are what we use to transform latitude and longitude coordinates into more meaningful units, like metres, by transferring the datum to a planar (cartesian) coordinate system. . Terminology . Remember latitude and longitude? In the context of projections, it may be useful to think of these as lines that have another name to describe them. . Lines of latitude are also called parallels and run east-west parallel to the equator. . Lines of longitude are called meridians and run north-south between the North and South Poles. . Parallels and meridians form a graticule. Melita Kennedy, Esri. &nbsp; . Map projections are typically categorized into three different types, based on the visualization of light shining through the earth onto a surface, where the surface is a plane, a cylinder, or a cone, respectively. . The concept of projection. Types of Map Projections, Jochen Albrecht. &nbsp; . There are also those who recommend dispensing with the three projection categories because they don’t account for all projections and can lead to misunderstanding and confusion. . Nevertheless, these three categories can be useful models for illustrating some map projections. . Projections based on each surface can be used for mapping particular parts of the world. . Where each respective surface touches the earth is also the area of the world portrayed most accurately using one of the three surfaces described below. . Planar/Azimuthal Projections . Possible aspects of planar projections. Melita Kennedy, Esri. &nbsp; . area and shape distortion are circular around the point of contact, so these projections accommodate circular regions better than rectangular regions | point of contact can be anywhere on earth’s surface but north and south poles most common point of contact | longitude lines converge at the north pole and radiate outward | latitude lines appear as a series of concentric circles | distances from or through the map center are true | directions from the map center to any other point are also held true | any other measure of distance or direction will not be true | not good for world maps because only show about half of earth at a time | . Example of an azimuthal projection in the polar region. Map Projections, Richard S. Courtney. &nbsp; . Cylindrical Projections . Possible aspects of cylindrical projections. Melita Kennedy, Esri. &nbsp; . Mercator projection is a cylindrical projection with line of tangency at equator | produce maps with straight, evenly-spaced meridians and straight parallels that intersect meridians at right angles | touch the globe along a line rather than a point, as with planar | display true direction along straight lines | a cylinder wrapped around a globe will cover more of the globe than either a plane or cone can | tend to be better for world maps but still can’t show All of earth’s surface | . Example of an cylindrical projection. Map Projections, Richard S. Courtney. &nbsp; . Conical Projections . A conic projection tangent to the globe along the standard parallel. Melita Kennedy, Esri. &nbsp; . used for midlatitude zones that have an east-to-west orientation (because cone wider than it is tall) | single cone cannot show the whole globe | conic maps show only a sector of a complete circle…they don’t develop into a complete circle | produce maps with straight converging longitude lines and concentric circular arcs for latitude lines | simplest conic projection contacts the globe along a single latitude line, a tangent, called the standard parallel | distortion increases north and south of the standard parallel | . Example of a conic projection in the mid-latitude region. Map Projections, Richard S. Courtney. &nbsp; . In the next section, we’ll go over choosing the right projection for your data. . This section uses ideas and images from Wikipedia, Projected Coordinate Systems, Understanding Map Projections, Light Source Metaphor, and 361 Lectures, and Map Projections. .",
