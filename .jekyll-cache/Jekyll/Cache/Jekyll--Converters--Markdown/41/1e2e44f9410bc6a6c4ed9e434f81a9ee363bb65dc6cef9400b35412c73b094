<p>Letâ€™s revisit some of the main topics we have covered so far.</p>

<p>See if you can answer the questions below before you reveal the correct answer by clicking on the text of the question.</p>

<details>
<summary>What are the two different kinds of coordinate systems?</summary>

<i>Geographic and projected.</i>
</details>
<p><br /></p>

<details>
<summary>It is best to measure distance and area with a coordinate system using latitude and longitude as its units. True or False. </summary>

<i>False. Latitude and longitude are angular measures and not appropriate for measuring distance or area. Use a projected coordinate system to more accurately measure distances between two locations on the surface of the earth.</i>
</details>
<p><br /></p>

<details>
<summary>Who can identify the projection below and which properties it preserves and distorts?</summary>

- <i>The Web Mercator projection preserves direction and shape.
<br />
- In web maps, it's also good for generating map tiles because it projects the world into a square evenly subdivided across zoom levels, and 90 degree turns appear as right angles.
<br />
- The Mercator projection distorts size, or area. Notice the classic example of comparing the size of Greenland to the continent of Africa in this map.</i>

<h3 id="recap">Recap</h3>

<p>Projections are what we use to transform latitude and longitude coordinates into more meaningful units, like metres, by transferring the datum to a planar (cartesian) coordinate system.</p>

<h3 id="terminology">Terminology</h3>

<p>Remember latitude and longitude? In the context of projections, it may be useful to think of these as lines that have another name to describe them.</p>

<p>Lines of latitude are also called parallels and run east-west parallel to the equator.</p>

<p>Lines of longitude are called meridians and run north-south between the North and South Poles.</p>

<p>Map projections are typically categorized into three different types, based on the visualization of light shining through the earth onto a surface, where the surface is a plane, a cylinder, or a cone, respectively.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>There are also those who <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map_projection#Projections_by_surface">recommend</a> dispensing with the three projection categories because they donâ€™t account for all projections and can lead to misunderstanding and confusion.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, these three categories can be useful models for illustrating some map projections.</p>

<p>Projections based on each surface can be used for mapping particular parts of the world.</p>

<p>Where each respective surface touches the earth is also the area of the world portrayed most accurately using one of the three surfaces described below.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
  <li>area and shape distortion are circular around the point of contact, so these projections accommodate circular regions better than rectangular regions</li>
  <li>point of contact can be anywhere on earthâ€™s surface but north and south poles most common point of contact</li>
  <li>longitude lines converge at the north pole and radiate outward</li>
  <li>latitude lines appear as a series of concentric circles</li>
  <li>distances from or through the map center are true</li>
  <li>directions from the map center to any other point are also held true</li>
  <li>any other measure of distance or direction will not be true</li>
  <li>not good for world maps because only show about half of earth at a time</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
  <li>Mercator projection is a cylindrical projection with line of tangency at equator</li>
  <li>produce maps with straight, evenly-spaced meridians and straight parallels that intersect meridians at right angles</li>
  <li>touch the globe along a line rather than a point, as with planar</li>
  <li>display true direction along straight lines</li>
  <li>a cylinder wrapped around a globe will cover more of the globe than either a plane or cone can</li>
  <li>tend to be better for world maps but still canâ€™t show All of earthâ€™s surface</li>
</ul>

</figure>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
  <li>used for midlatitude zones that have an east-to-west orientation (because cone wider than it is tall)</li>
  <li>single cone cannot show the whole globe</li>
  <li>conic maps show only a sector of a complete circleâ€¦they donâ€™t develop into a complete circle</li>
  <li>produce maps with straight converging longitude lines and concentric circular arcs for latitude lines</li>
  <li>simplest conic projection contacts the globe along a single latitude line, a tangent, called the standard parallel</li>
  <li>distortion increases north and south of the standard parallel</li>
</ul>
